Urban waste management remains a persistent issue despite advancements in science and
technology. Traditional waste collection and disposal systems face inefficiencies that result
in environmental pollution and health hazards. This paper proposes an integrated smart
waste management system utilizing IoT, data analytics, and dynamic routing to optimize
waste collection, segregation, and disposal. The proposed solution aims to enhance
efficiency, reduce operational costs, and promote environmental sustainability.
